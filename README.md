# Programming in Lua 4th Edition
---------

This is a repo with my own solutions and thoughts regarding the book "Programming in Lua, 4th Edition (2016)" by Roberto Ierusalimschy.

Resources:
- The book's page: https://www.lua.org/pil/
- Style guide: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Lua_style_guide

Disclaimer: I'm not the author of the book -- just a random game developer with zero Lua experience. Feel free to use this code however you'd like. And if you ever want to chat about Lua, C++, game development, mental health, or anything else, don't hesitate to reach out!
